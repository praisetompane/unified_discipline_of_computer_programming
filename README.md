# What is Computer Programming?
objectives(Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):
- attempts to define computer programming as a unified discipline using programming concepts, programming techniques independent of programming languages.

- def programming concepts (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):
   - these are organized in terms of/in relation to computation models:
      - def computation model: formal system, that defines how computations are done (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):

         - based on a simple core language called its kernel language (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiv)
            - def kernel language: TBD

         - defined in terms of (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):
            - data types
            - operations
            - a programming language 
   
            **NB** there are other ways to define computation models:
               - finite automata (Sipser, 2012:xvii) 

         - provides:
            - a programming model:
               - def programming model: a set of programming techniques and design principles
                                          used to write programs
                                          in the language of the computation model (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:29).
                  - def programming techniques: TBD
                  - def design principles: TBD 
            - set of techniques for:
               - reasoning about programs

def creative extension principle: main criterion for when and which concept to add to a computation mode/kernel language (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiv)

def computer programming: the act of extending or
                    changing a system's functionality (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xv).
   - practitioners:
      - general users: by changing the setting of an alarm
      - expert users: by writing new features for the system or updating existing

   - example:
      - extending a system's functionality:
         - writing a new application for iOS

      - changing a system's functionality:
         - moving iOS from using 4 digits to 7 digits passwords
