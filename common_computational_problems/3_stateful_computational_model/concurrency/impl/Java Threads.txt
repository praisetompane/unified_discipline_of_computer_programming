Threads in Java
    Every Thread(on the Operating System√ü) in Java is CREATED and CONTROLLED by an object 
        of the java.lang.Thread class.

    When a standalong program starts up, 
        a user Thread is automatically created to run the main() method.
            This is called the main Thread.


    You can run threaded programming by implementing
        java.lang.Thread
        java.lang.Runnable
