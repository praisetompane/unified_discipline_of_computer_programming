    Context:
        Given two numbers represented as a
            each represented as a (singly)linkedlist

    Objective:
        Write function that: 
            adds the two numbers
            returns sum as linkedlist

    Defintions:

    Contraints:

    Assumptions:
        base 10 number system
    Example:

        input = (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5)
        output = (9 -> 1 -> 2)

    Options:
        1: Use doubly linked list
            keep pointer to head and tail
            for forward addition
                start from the tail.
            I CHOOSE THIS ONE, as per the book progression I do not know Stacks yet! :)
        2. Use stacks
            convert the linked list into stacks
                - Can be:
                    - a node based stack
                    - a list based stack
                7   5
                1   9
                6   2
                    removing the head and add it to stack
                    the last value(i.e. ones places will be the first values we process(i.e.))
                Each place value addition result is added to a stack
                    We'll start at the ones,
                    therefore the highest place value(i.e. will be the last inserted, thus the first removed when 
                    converting the result to integer)
            result stack
                9
                1
                2
                which is equal to 912
