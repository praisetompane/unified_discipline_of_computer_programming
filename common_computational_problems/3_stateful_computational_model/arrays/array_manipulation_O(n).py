    for all a, b, k:
        set instruction to increment by k:
            from index a to index n: HOW? 
                    mark where the increase by k must start with k(i.e. array[a] = 100)
                BUT since we actually ONLY want to increment by until index b
                    set instruction to decrement by k from {b + 1 to n} HOW?
                        mark where the decrease by k must start with -k(i.e. array[b+1] = -k)
                    
    NB: Since we are not actually goin from a to b<=n
        the cost of setting the instruction to:
            increment by k
            decrement by k
            is O(1)
