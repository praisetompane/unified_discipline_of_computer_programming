    Context:
        Given Image
            Represented by N*N matrix
            Each pixel = 4bytes

    Definitions:
        Rotate by 90 degrees? 

    Objective:
        Function to rotate the image 90 degrees
       
    Assumptions:
        Rotation is clockwise

    Constraints:

    Algorithm flow:
        Clockwise Rotation => x, y : Cartesian
            (x,y) => (y, -1*x)
            
        Map to Matrix => x,y
            (x, y) => (abs(x),abs(y))

        create new matrix N*N matrix
        for each point (row,col) in grid
            new_cartesian_point = apply Clockwise Rotation above
            matrix_point = apply  Map to Matrix
            set matrix_point to value at (row,col)

    Possible Solutions
    
    Example(s):
        N = 4
        New Image:
            XXX
            XXX
            XXX

        Current Image:
            ABC  (0,0)(0,1)(0,2)
            EFG  (1,0)(1,1)(1,2)
            IJK  (2,0)(2,1)(2,2)

        Result:

            AEI
            BFJ
            CGK
