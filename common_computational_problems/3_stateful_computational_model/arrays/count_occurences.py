    Context:
        Given:
            array of integers
                unsorted
            each element appears twice except for one
    Objective:
        Find the the unique element
        
    Example:
        a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3]
        unique 4
    
    Assumtions:
        there will always be a lonlely integer (i.e. n will always be odd)
        
    Flow
        option 1: O(N + N) = O(2N) = O(N)
            initialise empty hash occurances = array_value -> count
            for each value in a
                store count in occurances
            find entry(key) with only one occurances
            CHOSE THIS ONE
        Option 2: O(NlogN + N)
            sort
            return number whose adjacent is not equal to itself
        
        Option 3: O(N) + O(1) = O(N) = WRONG THOUGH
            Since an odd number + odd number = even
                  an even number + odd number = even    
                  sum of n(which odd) is going to be odd
                  
            lonlely_integer = sum(a)%2
            
    Constraints: 
        1 <= n <= 100: size of the array
        0 <= arr[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= 100(n)
