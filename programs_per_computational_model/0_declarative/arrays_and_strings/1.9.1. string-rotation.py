    Context:
        Given:

    Definitions:
        rotation = letters moved n places left/right
            split string into two parts
                x,y
                rotated  string = yx

        is not:
            shuffling letters into arbitary positions
            
    Objective:
        Given two strings
            s1 and s2

        Write Algorithm to check
            if s2 is a 
                rotation
                    of s1
            
    Assumptions:
        s1 and s2 are same length
    Constraints:
        Only 1 call to isSubstring

    Algorithm flow:
        Using definition of rotation
            yxyx contains xy
            cdabcd contains abcd

        Flow:
            s2contact = concat s2 and s2
            check if s1 isSubstring of s2contact
