    Given:
        array of integers
    Objective:
        return a frequency array of the elements
            count the number of times a value appears in the array
        NB: Aways return a 100 value frequency array 
    Assumptions:
    
    Example:
        arr = [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
        values range = [0 ... 3]
        
    Flow
        frequencies = [0] * values range
        for n in arr:
            frequencies[n] += 1
        from the start of the array(i.e. index 0)
            append each index(i.e. the number) to sorted array
                as many times as stiputed by its frequncy    

    # => result will be a sorted array
    Constraints:
        100 <= n <= 10^6 : size of the array
        0 <= arr[i] < 100 range of values
    Performance
            O(N): we visit each array element
            O(100): initialise frequncy table of size 100
            O(N + 100) = O(N) : drop constants
