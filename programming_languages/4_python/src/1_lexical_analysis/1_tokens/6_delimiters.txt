def delimiter:
    a character that marks
        the beginning or end of a unit of data (Merriam-Webster).

    a sequence of one or more characters
        that mark the boundary
        between two independent regions
            in plain text, mathematical expressions or any data stream (Wikipedia).

python delimiters (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    Q: they mark the beginning or end of tokens/lexemes?

    "construction":
        ( ) : function parameters, expression grouping
        [ ] : list parameters
        { } : dictionary parameters

    augmented assignments:
        NB: serve lexically as delimiters, but also perform an operation (Python Software Foundation, 2023).
        
        +=
        -=
        *=
        /=
        //=
        %=
        @=

        <<=
        >>=
        &=
        |=
        ^=
        ~=

        meaning: operate using both operands
            then assign the result to the left operand.

        NB: pattern: {operator}{assignment}

    other:
        :
        ,
        .
        ... : ellipsis literal

        ;
        @
        =
        ->
            : empty space
