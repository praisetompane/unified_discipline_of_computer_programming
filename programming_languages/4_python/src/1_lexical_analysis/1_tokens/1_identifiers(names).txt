properties (Python Software Foundation, 2023)
    - Python 2.x:
        valid characters to use in identifier: 
            ASCII range
                - A to Z 
                - a to z
                - _ (underscore)
                - 0 to 9, but NOT as the first character of the identifier.
    - Python 3.x
        - all Python 2.x valid characters
        - non-ASCII characters as defined here:
            https://peps.python.org/pep-3131/

    - unlimited length [only bound by computer's memory]
    - case is significant
    - ALL characters are converted to Unicode Normalization form NFKC during parsing:
        - this form is used for comparisons.

reserved classes of identifiers (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - identifiers besides keywords that have special meaning.
        - they are denoted by a pattern of leading or trailing underscores.
    - classes:
        - _* : stipulates do no import during "from module_x import *"
        - _ :
            - wildcard in case statement in pattern match context.
            - convention (not enforced by Python)
                - unused variables
                - "special" values
                - internationalization
                - private class members
            - in REPL, stored last result

        - __*__ : used for system-defined names ("dunder" names).
                    - defined by interpreter and its implementation; including the Standard Library.
                    - ANY usage of __*__ names in an undocumented manner is subject to be broken without warning.

        - __* : private class members
                    - through name mangling are renamed to using patter : classname__*
                        example: 
                            see: ./src/1_identifiers(names)_class_subtyping_overrides.py                                 

                    - this is to help prevent name overriding in class hierarchies
