- numeric literals (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - integer literals
    - floating-point literals
    - imaginary literals

    - integer literals:
        - leading zeros for nonzero literals are illegal
        - unlimited length [only bound by computer's memory]

    - floating-point literals:
        - length/range is implementation dependent
        - for e, the number afterward is the number of succeeding zeros.
            the integer and exponent are both radix 10(i.e. base 10)
            
            i.e. 2e2 = 200 = 2 followed by 2 zeros
                    2e2 ≠ 2 × 2 = 4

    - imaginary literals:
        - properties:
            - defaults to complex number with zero real part
            - both real real parts have same range
                i.e. given:
                    a + bi, a,b ∈ ℝ
                    a and b have same value range

            see for complex number definition:
                3_mathematics/1_algebra/3_complex_numbers/0_def.txt

        examples:
            see: ./src/4_2_literals_numeric_imaginary_and_complex.py

        NB: complex literals DO NOT exist:
            - you manually combine real and imaginary literals to build them.
        
    universal properties:
        - they are unsigned
    
        - underscores are excluded when determining the literal's value
