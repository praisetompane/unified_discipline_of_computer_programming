def implicit line joining (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    join row or more physical lines
        into one logical line
        with '[]', '{}', '()' or '""" """'

    properties:
        - comments allowed at the end
            - comment disallowed for '""" """'
        - does not require explicit '\'
        - blank line continuations are allowed
        - indentation between continuation lines is not enforced
        - does not generate NEWLINE token.
