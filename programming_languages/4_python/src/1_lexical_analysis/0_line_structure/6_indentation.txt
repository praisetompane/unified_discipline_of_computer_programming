def indentation (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - leading white space(tabs or spaces)
        at beginning of a logical line
            is used to calculate indentation level
                of the line.

        - the indentation level is used to calculate grouping of statements.
    
        example:
            valid code:
                def test():
                            print("1")
                NB: notice print is 3 tabs indented.
                        you can indent the first statement arbitrarily deep.

            invalid code:
                def test():
                            print("1")
                        print("2)
                NB: The first line "print("1")" is used to calculate indentation level at 3 tabs.
                        print("2") is less than that, hence it fails with IndentationError.
    - properties:
        - total spaces preceding
            first non-blank character determine's the line indentation.
        - cannot be split across physical lines with '\'.
        - white space preceding first '\' terminates indentation
        - invalid if contains inconsistent use of tabs and spaces.
            raises TabError
            def TabError: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/exceptions.html#TabError
    - formfeed character
        - if first character in the line:
            - ignored for indentation calculations
        - if found else where in the leading whitespace
            - has undefined effect
                - may reset space count to zero.
    - algorithm:
        def: indentation levels
            of consecutive lines
            are used to generate
                INDENT and DETENT tokens

        data structure: stack
            - stack invariant = numbers in increasing order.
        flow:
            - push zero onto stack.
            - for all lines:
                calculate line_indentation_level
                if line_indentation_level == stack_top_value, then
                    do nothing
                if line_indentation_level > stack_top_value, then
                    add line_indentation_level to stack
                    generate INDENT token
                else #line_indentation_level < stack_top_value, then
                    line_indentation_level MUST be on stack
                    for all stack_values 
                        if stack_value > line_indentation_level, then
                            pop off
                            generate DETENT token
                    for all stack values #remaining ones
                        if stack_value > 0
                            generate DETENT token
