def name: sequence of characters
            that refer to objects (Python Software Foundation, 2023).
        def object: TBD.

def name binding (Python Software Foundation, 2023): the act of introducing a name
                                                        to point/refer to an object.
    - name binding constructs/operations:
        - formal parameters to functions.
        - function definitions.
        - class definitions.
        - assignments:
            - occur in block defined by:
                - class
                - function
                - module (top-level code block).
        - import statements:
            - occur in block defined by:
                - class
                - function
                - module (top-level code block).
            - "from ... import *" binds all names in the imported module 
                except underscored one.
            
        - targets that are identifiers if occurring in an assignment:
            - for loop header
            - after ùëéùë† in: #
                - with statement
                - except, except* clause
                - as-in structural pattern matching. 
                - in a capture pattern in structural pattern matching.
        - targets of 'del' as considered bound too
        def targets: TBD
        
    - name locality:
        - names defined in block are local to the block
            - unless defined as nonlocal or global
