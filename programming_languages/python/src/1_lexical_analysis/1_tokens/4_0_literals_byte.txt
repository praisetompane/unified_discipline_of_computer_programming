byte literals (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - bytes:
        - properties:
            - prefix: "b" | "B" | "br" | "Br" | "bR" | "BR" | "rb" | "rB" | "Rb" | "RB"
            - character set:
                - only ASCII
                    - overrules encoding declarations and Python UTF-8 default
                - valid characters (AKA source characters) can ONLY be ASCII
                    - NB: This overrules any encoding declaration.
            - must ALWAYS be prefixed with 'b' or 'B'.
            - produces an instance of 𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠 type.
                𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠 details: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/stdtypes.html#bytes
            - bytes with a numeric value greater than 127
                MUST be expressed with escapes.
                Q: Why?
            - Python 3.3 supports the 'rb' prefix for raw bytes
                synonym to 'br' prefix
