def explicit line joining (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    join two or more physical lines
        into one logical line
        with '\'.

    the interpreter remove the '\' and end-of-line character.
    
    '\' properties:
        - must be outside string or comment to work.
        - line ending with it, cannot have a comment.
        - can only be used to split string literals
            across physical lines.
            example:
                if I wanted to set 'number' with value 342452423442245323234234342343432342
                    but its too long in the editor:
                    NB: I cannot split it, the statement below is illegal:
                        number = 342452423442245323234234 \
                                    342343432342 
                    
        - illegal elsewhere on logical lines
            except string literals.
