Get the firstValue,N[1]
Set i to 2
set location to index of firstValue
smallest = firstValueN[1]

while i is less than size of list N,do steps 8 through 17

if smallest is less than N[i],then

smallest= smallest
Add 1 to i

else

smallest = N[i]
set location to inded of this value
Add 1 to i

End of loop
Print smallest and i
