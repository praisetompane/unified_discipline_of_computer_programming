Get the firstValue,N[1]
Set i to 2
biggest = firstValue N[1]
set location to index of firstValue

while i is less than size of list N,do steps 7 through 16

if biggest is greater than N[i],then

biggest = biggest
Add 1 to i

else

biggest = N[i]
set location to inded of this value
Add 1 to i

End of loop
Print biggest and i
