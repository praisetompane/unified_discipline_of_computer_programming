        is-a-subtype-of relationship attributes:
            - conversion from a subtype to supertype is implicitly applied(by compiler, runtime, etc)
            - conversion of subtype to supertype does not NEED to change memory
            - transitive and reflexive
                transitive: the lowest subtype of type is also the subtype of all its supertypes
                reflexive: a type is a substype of itself
