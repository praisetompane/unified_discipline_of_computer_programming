Members
	public:
	The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.

	private:
	The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.

	protected:
	The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct, or in a class that is derived from that class.

	internal:
	The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

	protected internal:
	The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a 
	derived class in another assembly. Access from another assembly must take place within a class declaration that derives from 
	the class in which the protected internal element is declared, and it must take place through an instance of the derived class type.
