Delegation
	Ability to replace the "delegate" object with ease	

	Use: When clients of a class need functionality from another class

	class Manager{

		Subordinate_obj = new Subordinate();
		Subordinate_obj.dowork(); --delegation

		public void reportToMD(){

		}
 
	}
	Delegates exist on a funcional/method level in C# as well (delegate keyword) Not for oop though

KEY

	Parameterizing code(use of the C# delegate keyword)

	Calling methods in other classes (prefer this one better, relates to the manager explanation above) : The "has a" relationship
