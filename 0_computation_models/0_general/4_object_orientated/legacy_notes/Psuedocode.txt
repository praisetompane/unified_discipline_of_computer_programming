POWER OF PSUEDOCODE
	
	Define problem	
	
	Define solution
		What the solution needs 
			Data
			Certain conditions to be true
		Imperative side(the how of the solution?)
			Processing and solving problem
	
For looping and selection, The keywords that are to be used include

Keywords:

	Do While...EndDo; 
	Do Until...Enddo; 
	Case...EndCase; 
	If...Endif; 
	Call ... with (parameters); 
	Call; Return ....; 
	Return; 
	When; 
	Always use scope terminators for loops and iteration.
	
As verbs
	use the words Generate,
	Compute, 
	Process, etc. Words such as 
	set, 
	reset, 
	increment, 
	compute, 
	calculate, 
	add, 
	sum, 
	multiply, ... 
	print, 
	display, 
	input, 
	output, 
	edit, 
	test , 
	etc. with careful indentation tend to foster desirable pseudocode.

Do not include data declarations in your pseudocode.

Possible:

	Sort Algorithms

	Fibonacci

	Search algorithms
